<h3>My musical journey started when I was about 12 when I started listening to rock, mostly the mainstream classics you would normally hear on rock stations and the stuff my dad had on vinyl at that time. The first band I deepdove int
were actually The Beatles and I can still name most of their songs. I started listening to metal when I heard <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6mdiAmATAx73kdxrNrnlao?si=BrSfoljTQgCHqePRkxqYNQ">Iron Maiden</a>'s
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Zc7TCHzuNwL0AFBlyLdyr?si=69505c9e57ce4751">Run to the Hills</a> on the radio and that's when I deepdove into Iron Maiden which was the only metal band I knew for some time, I soon discovered
Metallica and Megadeth and that's how I started exploring my musical horizon.</h3>
